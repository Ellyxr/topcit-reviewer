## I.01 Overview of Information Security

### Key Concepts and Definitions

*   **Information security:** Protecting information administratively, physically, and technically to prevent damage, alteration, and leakage during collection, storage, processing, and transmission.
*   **Three Goals of Information Security:** Efforts should be made to ensure these attributes administratively, physically, and technically.
    *   **Confidentiality:** Means the original information is not exposed to unauthorized users while being stored and transmitted.
    *   **Integrity:** Means the original information is maintained while sending and receiving it, without illegal creation, modification, or deletion.
    *   **Availability:** Means that authorized users can access and use the requested information when necessary.

## I.02 Basic terms of information security

### Key Concepts and Definitions

*   **Authentication:** A method of verifying whether information exchanged has not been altered or deleted, and whether the subjects (sender and receiver) are legitimate.
*   **Non-repudiation:** Security technology used to prevent the repudiation (denial) after receiving or sending a message by verifying the fact of message receiving or sending.
    *   **Categories of Non-repudiation:**
        1.  **Non-repudiation of origin:** Prevents the sender's claim that the message was not received after actually receiving it.
        2.  **Non-repudiation of delivery:** Prevents the receiver's claim that the message was not delivered after actually sending it.
        3.  **Non-repudiation of receipt:** Prevents the receiver's claim that the message was not received after actually receiving it.
*   **Cryptography:** Largely classified into symmetric cryptographic techniques and encryption protocol techniques.
*   **Digital signature:** A method of providing both data integrity and signature authentication, performed by a hash operation on a specific document using the signature's private key. An electronic signature is generated by calculating a hash value for the message.
*   **Hash function (Hash algorithm):** A mathematical function that converts a random string of various sizes into a hash value (hash code) of fixed length, outputting it.
    *   ***Detail:*** Unlike encryption algorithms, the hash function does not use a key. It is used for integrity verification.
*   **Malware:** Malicious software designed to perform malicious actions against computers, file systems, or networks.
    *   **Example: Types of Malware:**
        *   **Worms:** Malware that runs independently and replicates itself to other computers.
        *   **Viruses:** Malicious codes inserted into the code of another independent program, performing malicious behavior when spread.
        *   **Trojan horse:** A program with hidden codes that looks like a normal program but executes malicious code when the user runs it.

# II. Fundamental Technologies for Information Security

**Summary of Section II:** This section covers the core technical mechanisms used to achieve information security goals: cryptographic techniques (encryption/hashing) for confidentiality and integrity, authentication technology (passwords, biometrics, PKI) for identity verification, and access control for determining authorization.

---

## II.01 Cryptographic techniques

### A) Concept of encryption and decryption

*   **Encryption (Cipher):** The process of converting plain text into a form (ciphertext) that cannot be recognized by a third party. Encryption is a key means to obtain confidentiality.
*   **Decryption:** The reverse process of encryption; converting ciphertext back into plain text.

### B) Classification of cryptographic techniques

Cryptographic techniques are classified into cryptographic techniques (using symmetric or public key cryptosystems) and cryptographic protocols (using cryptographics techniques to achieve specific purposes like authentication, confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation).

### C) Private key encryption and public key cryptographic algorithm

| Feature                          | Private Key Cryptography (Symmetric)                                     | Public Key Cryptography                                      |
| :------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Key relationship**             | Encryption key = Decryption key (Same key)                                 | Encryption key ≠ Decryption key (Different keys)             |
| **Encryption/Decryption speed**  | High speed (Fast encryption/decryption time)                               | Low speed (Slow encryption/decryption time)                  |
| **Number of keys to be managed** | Increases as the number of users increases (n*(n-1)/2)                    | Fewer keys (2n) to manage                                    |
| **Strengths**                    | Fast execution time, short key length                                      | Easy key distribution, used in various fields                |
| **Examples of Algorithms**       | AES, DES                                                                   | RSA, ElGamal, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem)              |

### D) Hash function (Integrity)

*   **Operation:** A mathematical function outputs a fixed short hash value from an input string of random length.
*   **Properties of Hash Function:**
    *   **Pre-image resistance:** If output *y* is given, it is difficult to find input *x* where h(*x*)=*y*.
    *   **Collision resistance:** It is difficult to find *x* and *x'* (where *x* ≠ *x'*) such that h(*x*)=h(*x'*).
*   **Supplementing functions:** **Salting** is an arbitrary bit string added to a hash function to generate a hash value, used to improve the possibility of recognition for user passwords.
    *   ***Example:*** A password "@Kr5792cc" combined with salt "topcit" generates the final hash value.
*   **Integrity during transmission:** The hash function is used in the form of a message authentication code (MAC) to protect the integrity of the message transmitted over the network.

---

## II.02 Authentication technology

### A) Concept and types of authentication

*   **Authentication:** Refers to verifying the legitimacy of the sender and receiver.
    *   **User authentication:** Enables the user to prove their identity to the other party over the network.
    *   **Message authentication:** Checks whether the contents of the transmitted message have the original information and are not altered or modified.
*   **Types of Authentication Methods (based on user characteristics):**
    1.  **Knowledge-based:** Based on "What you know" (e.g., password, PIN).
    2.  **Ownership-based:** Based on "What you have" (e.g., OTP, smart card, key).
    3.  **Presence-based (Biometrics):** Based on "What you are" (e.g., iris recognition, fingerprint recognition).

### B) Authentication technologies (Detailed)

1.  **Password authentication:** Although widely used, it is the most insecure due to vulnerabilities like easy guessing and storage/transfer in plain text.
    *   ***Countermeasures:*** Using a password generator or implementing an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) to detect dictionary attacks and brute force attacks.
2.  **One Time Password (OTP) authentication:** Uses a one-time password generated by the authentication system.
    *   **Synchronous OTP:** Includes Challenge-response and Time-synchronous types.
    *   **Asynchronous OTP:** Includes Event-synchronous types.
3.  **Biometric authentication:** Uses an automated sensor to extract measurable physical or behavioral features.
    *   **Characteristics:** Universality, Distinctiveness, Permanence, Accuracy, and Acceptability.
    *   ***Example:*** Fingerprint (occupies the largest market share), Iris (very accurate but expensive), Face, Vein, DNA, Signature, Voice.
    *   **Multi-factor authentication:** Improves security by combining multiple authentication technologies (e.g., OTP + fingerprint recognition).
4.  **Electronic signature:** A technology that enables the user to sign an electronic document using the authentication function of encryption technology. It provides sender authentication, non-repudiation, and message integrity.
    *   **Procedure (6 phases):**
        1.  Sender generates a message digest (hash).
        2.  Sender creates an electronic signature by encrypting the digest using the sender's private key.
        3.  Sender transmits message/signature.
        4.  Receiver extracts message digest by decrypting signature using sender's public key.
        5.  Receiver generates a new message digest.
        6.  Receiver compares the two message digests.

### C) PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)

*   **Definition:** PKI is an infrastructure for managing the public key for encryption and authentication, distributing encryption keys and security certificates.
*   **Components:** Policy Approval Authority (PAA), Policy Certification Authority (PCA), Certification Authority (CA), and Registration Authority (RA).
*   **Operation (Electronic signature and encryption):** The PKI environment uses a session key (one-time secret key) for encryption to ensure message confidentiality. This key is secured using the receiver's public key, creating an electronic envelope.
*   **Verification of certificates:** Done through the CRL (Certificate Revocation List) which lists revoked certificates, or the OCSP (Online Certificate Status Protocol).

---

## II.03 Access control technology

### A) Overview and Procedure of access control

*   **Access control:** Refers to the task of controlling who can access a system, and what task the user can perform.
*   **Access Control Procedure (3 parts):**
    1.  **Identification:** Process of identifying a subject using a unique token (e.g., ID, employee card).
    2.  **Authentication:** Process where the system verifies the subject's identity (e.g., password, OTP).
    3.  **Authorization:** Process where the system controls the task and object performed by the authenticated user (e.g., DAC, MAC, RBAC).

### B) Access control policies

*   **Minimum privilege policy:** Also called the "need-to-know" policy; subjects use the minimum amount of information required for their activities.
*   **Maximum privilege policy:** Based on the principle of maximum availability; applicable when data sharing benefits need to be increased.

### C) Types of access control policies

1.  **Mandatory Access Control (MAC):** Access is given to the subject and object a security label is given. Used mainly for military purposes.
2.  **Discretionary Access Control (DAC):** Access controlled by the identity of the subject's account or the account's belonging group. The owner of the object determines access permission.
    *   ***Example:*** The owner of a table can grant or revoke the privilege to another person.
3.  **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access determined by the administrator defining roles and mapping them to subjects and objects. The central administrator controls the relationship between the subject and object based on their roles in the organization.

### D) Access control models (Examples)

*   **Bell-Lapadula model:** Emphasizes confidentiality and secret leakage prevention.
*   **Biba model:** Designed to guarantee integrity.
*   **Chinese wall model (Brewer-Nash):** Applies the concept of task separation to prevent conflicts of interest.

*   **Secure SDLC (Secure Software Development Lifecycle):** Ensures security measures are reviewed throughout the entire software lifecycle, from requirements definition to maintenance operation.
    *   **Phases:** Requirement definition → Analysis/Design (including risk assessment) → Coding (Static security test) → Testing (Dynamic security test, Security audit) → Maintenance operation.

---

## V.02 Major secure coding techniques

### A) Major secure coding techniques for Java

1.  **Responding to the SQL injection attack:** An attacker reads or manipulates information in the database by inserting an SQL statement into the input form.
    *   **Secure Coding Technique:** Use the Prepared Statement object to handle transfers that compile query statements using a constant string.
    *   ***Example:*** Changing an unsafe Java code string concatenation `String sql = "select ... where b.gubin = '" + request.getParameter("gubin") + "'";` to use `preparedStatement` and parameter binding.
2.  **Responding to the Cross Site Scripting (XSS) attack:** An attacker inserts a malicious script into a web page to induce the user to execute it.
    *   **Secure Coding Technique:** Special characters such as `<`, `>`, and `&` should be replaced with equivalents (`&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`).
3.  **Responding to the OS command injection attack:** Unverified input is executed as system commands.
    *   **Secure Coding Technique:** An application program should be configured so that system commands are not transferred to the outside of the server through the web interface.

### B) Major secure coding techniques for C language

1.  **Responding to the memory buffer overflow attack:** Writing or reading data to a location beyond the allocated memory range.
    *   **Secure Coding Technique:** When using a memory buffer, set a proper buffer size, control reading/writing within the set range, and ensure the string is terminated with a null character.
2.  **Responding to the format string insertion attack:** The security weakness occurs when the input value is not verified and used as the format string of the input/output function.
    *   **Secure Coding Technique:** Do not use the user input value as a format string; instead, use safe functions like `fputs()` instead of `fprintf()` to output messages.

### C) Major secure coding techniques for Android-Java

1.  **Responding to the attack against the component that can be accessed from the outside:** If `android:exported="true"` is set in the manifest file for a component, it can be transferred from outside and breach security.
    *   **Secure Coding Technique:** Set `android:exported="false"`.

## VI.02 Database access control

*   **Database Access Control Policy Types:**
    *   **Discretionary Access Control (DAC) policy:** The owner of the object determines access permission (e.g., owner of the table can grant or revoke privileges).
    *   **Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policy:** Access is controlled based on the owner's rights to the confidential object.
    *   **Role-based Access Control (RBAC) policy:** The central administrator controls the relationship between the subject and object, decided based on their roles.
*   **Methods of controlling access to the database:**
    1.  **Agent method:** Accessing a database using a dedicated client for database access after installing an agent.
    2.  **Gateway method:** Passing all database server connection requests through a database access control server (proxy server).
    3.  **Network sniffing method:** Analyzing and logging network packets using TAP equipment without a separate agent or server configuration.

## VI.03 Database encryption

*   **Types of database encryption:**
    1.  **API method:** Encryption/decryption is installed inside an application program module. It is easy to modify and maintain.
    2.  **Plug-in type:** Encryption/decryption is installed inside the database server. Recommended when database performance is good and modification of the application program is difficult.
    3.  **TDE method:** Uses the built-in or optional encryption/decryption function of the database; requires no modification to the application program.
*   **Applying database encryption:**
    *   **One-way cipher algorithm (Hashing):** Generally SHA-256 is used for passwords. When passwords are stored in plain text, the SALT value (a random string) should be added to the user's password before applying the hash algorithm.
    *   **Two-way cipher algorithm:** Block cipher algorithms such as SEED, ARIA, and AES (Rijndael) are generally used for personal information.

---

## VI.04 Database encryption key management

*   **Types of database encryption keys:**
    *   **Encryption/decryption key:** A key used to encrypt and decrypt the already encrypted data.
    *   **Master key:** A key used to store and distribute the encryption/decryption key after encryption.
*   **Key storage stage:** Encryption keys should be stored using a separate key management server or an HSM (Hard Security Module).

# VII. System Architecture Security

**Summary of Section VII:** System architecture security focuses on configuring operating system security settings (Windows/Unix-like systems) to prevent system hijacking, unauthorized access, and privilege escalation.

---

## VII.01 Windows system security

*   **Account and password management:** Should involve deleting guest accounts and other unnecessary accounts. Security settings should include checking for vulnerable passwords and applying automatic account locks.
    *   ***Example:*** Setting account lockout: It is desirable to set "Account lockout duration" to 60 minutes and "Account lockout threshold" to 5 times.
*   **Access control:** Check unnecessary shared folders and stop sharing to limit access to only authorized users.
*   **System security:** Security measures include turning off automatic administrator logon and checking/deleting unnecessary startup programs.
*   **Service security:** Unnecessary startup services should be stopped.

---

## VII.02 Unix-like system security

*   **Account and password management:** Delete unnecessary accounts (e.g., using `userdel` or `rmuser` commands). Check the account that uses a vulnerable password; a password should use 8 or more characters and special characters.
*   **Access control:** Allowing access to authorized systems only. Setting a session idle timeout is important to prevent confidentiality breach.
*   **System security:** Check the `umask` setting to restrict the file creation rights of the current user.
*   **Service security:** Stopping unnecessary services is necessary, as unused services can cause security vulnerability. The use of Anonymous FTP should be restricted, and Secure FTP (SFTP) should be used instead.

# VIII. Understanding Network Security

**Summary of Section VIII:** Network security involves classifying attacks (passive/active), applying security protocols (IPSec, SSL/TLS) across different communication layers, and managing the unique security challenges of wireless networks (WLAN).

---

## VIII.01 Overview of network security

*   **Type of security attacks:**
    1.  **Passive attack:** An attack that attempts to eavesdrop or monitor transmitted data, such as traffic analysis or the release of message contents.
    2.  **Active attack:** An attack classified into masquerading, replay, modification of messages, and denial of service (DoS), which entails the illegal modification of transmitted data or the creation of false data.
*   **DoS attack (Denial of Service):** An attack that interferes with the normal operation of a specific server by causing various types of load.
    *   ***Examples:*** Land attack, Ping of death attack, Syn flooding attack (exploits TCP 3-way handshake vulnerability), Boink attack.
    *   **DDoS (Distributed DoS) attack:** The evolved type of DoS attack that uses multiple attack sources.
*   **Sniffing attack:** An attack that eavesdrops on all traffic by setting the network interface card in promiscuous mode.
*   **Spoofing attack:** The act of disguising and applying anything related to communication (IP address, host name, port number, MAC address) to attack other target systems.
    *   ***Example:*** ARP spoofing: A technique that maps fake MAC addresses to IP addresses, tricking MAC addresses.

---

## VIII.02 Security protocols and security solutions

*   **IPSec (Internet Protocol Security):** A protocol developed to make up for the security vulnerability of IPv4. It provides security functions (authentication and encryption) to the Internet layer (IP layer).
    *   **Composition:** Largely composed of IKE (Internet Key Exchange), SA (Security Association) negotiation, AH (Authentication Header) protocol (authentication), and ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) protocol (encryption).
    *   **Modes:** Transport mode (protects the upper layer protocol) and Tunnel mode (encrypts all IP datagrams, used to implement VPN).
*   **SSL (Secure Socket Layer)/TLS (Transport Layer Security):** A protocol that acts above the transport layer (TCP/IP transport layer) to provide reliable end-to-end security services.
    *   **Core functions:** Provides confidentiality and integrity using a determined secret key cipher algorithm.
    *   **Operation (5 phases):**
        1.  Client sends "hello" message.
        2.  Server sends server hello message, certificate, and public key.
        3.  Client verifies the certificate, creates a session key, and encrypts it with the server's public key.
        4.  Client sends signals for exchanging encrypted data.
        5.  Encrypted data is exchanged.
    *   **Utilization:** An SSL certificate should be installed in the web server to apply SSL, enabling HTTPS usage.

## VIII.03 WLAN security

*   **WLAN (Wireless LAN) Characteristics:** Due to the use of radio waves, it is more vulnerable than a wired LAN.
*   **WLAN security standard:** IEEE 802.11i (Wi-Fi Protected Access2 or WPA2) reinforces security.
*   **Security Threats:** Include leakage of important user information, DoS attacks, and hacking weak security settings (e.g., WEP).
*   **IEEE 802.11i components:** Supports three essential functions: Authentication (user/server authentication), Access control (key exchange), and Privacy (MAC layer data encrypted).
