# IT Business and Strategy Overview

## I. The Concept of IT Business

### Summary of Section I
IT business involves activities that **integrate information technology (IT) into corporate processes** to achieve business objectives[cite: 188]. It has evolved from a simple support function to a core, integrated element that creates a competitive advantage[cite: 189]. This section covers IT resources, management practices, and the IT business value chain[cite: 190].

### I.01 The Concept of IT Business: A Summary

#### Key Concepts and Definitions
* **IT business:** All activities carried out by integrating IT into a broad range of processes to realize the business objectives of a company[cite: 190].
* **Evolution of IT:** Initially used sparingly, computers now play a key role in companies' decision-making from an enterprise-wide perspective[cite: 191]. Since 2010, IT has been tightly merged with business processes to gain a competitive advantage[cite: 192].
* **Alignment of Business and IT:** IT's interdependence with business strategy objectives and processes is maximized[cite: 192].
* **Strategic Alignment:** The relationship between business and IT can be analyzed using a 2-dimensional diagram, subdivided into external focus (business environment) and internal focus (management)[cite: 193].
* **Strategic Links:** Requires achieving strategic alignment across four complementary areas: business strategy, IT strategy, organizational infrastructure and processes, and IT infrastructure and processes[cite: 194].

### I.02 IT Business Ecosystem

#### A) IT business and the hype cycle
The **Hype Cycle** shows changes in the expected level of industrial economic value and the impact of new technologies[cite: 194].

| Phase No. | Phase Name | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Innovation trigger | New technologies are first introduced, and people expect great things from them[cite: 195]. |
| 2 | Peak of Inflated Expectations | The period before the new technology starts to become more exaggerated than what it can actually deliver[cite: 196]. |
| 3 | Trough of Disillusionment | The period when the bubble bursts, after which the technology enters a period of retreat[cite: 197]. |
| 4 | Slope of Enlightenment | Organizations for the technology start to climb steadily once again[cite: 198]. |
| 5 | Plateau of Productivity | The period when the technology generates steady values[cite: 198]. |

#### C) Components of an IT business ecosystem
The IT ecosystem is composed of five components, referred to as **CPNDS** (Contents, Platform, Network, Device, and Security)[cite: 198].
* **Platform (P):** IT service providers are evolving from individual services to a common platform where multiple business partners gather[cite: 199]. (Example: Apple, Google, and Kakao [cite: 199]).
* **Security (S):** IT cyber threats are leading to an increase in damages due to the increased use of IT by key national infrastructures[cite: 200]. Cyber targeted attacks aim to steal information or damage corporate systems[cite: 200].

### I.03 IT Resources and Management Activities for IT Business

#### A) The concept of IT resources
**IT resources** encompass people, processes, software, and hardware used to run an IT business[cite: 200]. They include IT support systems and IT management systems (e.g., ERP, SCM, and PLM), along with IT infrastructure[cite: 200].

#### B) The role of IT resources
IT resources benefit businesses in three main ways:
1.  **Improved production efficiency:** Using IT resources to improve overall production efficiency[cite: 201]. (Example: Domestic supermarkets monitor customer purchasing patterns in real-time to maximize sales [cite: 202]).
2.  **Creation of new business values:** New business values emerge through the application of IT resources, such as Apple's online music distribution structure[cite: 203].
3.  **Expansion of global business:** IT resources enable a global cooperative working environment and exchange of information without space and time constraints[cite: 204].

#### C) Management activities and structure for IT business
The IT business's cyclical management activities follow the traditional **POCA** (Planning, Operation, Check, and Corrective Action) management cycle[cite: 204].
* **Plan (P):** Identify opportunities/issues, set goals/scope, and link business with IT[cite: 204].
* **Execution (O):** Configure IT solution and collect IT solution operational data[cite: 204].
* **Check (C):** Analyze IT solution operational results, monitor business-IT performance metrics, and test alignment[cite: 204].
* **Corrective action (A):** Identify required improvements, adjust/modify IT solution, and repeat the cycle[cite: 205].

### I.04 The IT Business Value Chain

#### A) Overview of the value chain
The **Value chain model** is a management theory that defines the ultimate direction of an enterprise organization[cite: 205].

| Value Chain Components | Key Activities | Support Activities |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Traditional Manufacturer** | Inbound goods, Operations, Outgoing goods, Marketing & sales, Service[cite: 205]. | Enterprise infrastructure, Technology development, HR management, Procurement activities[cite: 205]. |
| **E-commerce Company** | Electronic procurement, Zero inventory production, 3rd party shipment, Networks/sales, Online service[cite: 205]. | Integrated information platform and network infrastructure, Internet recruitment, training[cite: 205]. |

#### B) Company-wide integration of the value chain model and IT
IT is applied throughout all key activities and support activities that constitute the elements of a company's value chain model[cite: 206]. IT is no longer limited to back-office functions but is utilized as a key factor in every aspect of a company's key activities[cite: 207].

## III. Understanding IT Business Planning

### Summary of Section III
IT business planning starts with establishing a strategy, followed by deploying IT governance and key planning frameworks such as Enterprise Architecture (EA) and Information Strategic Planning (ISP) to secure IT integration and alignment[cite: 233].

### III.02 IT Governance

#### A) Concept of IT governance
**IT Governance** is a system for controlling and managing a company’s IT to align IT resources with a company's goals and strategies[cite: 233]. It encompasses the right leadership, organizational structure, and processes to maintain and expand business strategies[cite: 234].

#### B) Framework of IT governance
* **COBIT 5 (Control Objectives for Information and related Technology 5):** A reference model for IT governance[cite: 234].
    * **Governance Area:** Composed of 5 processes: evaluation (E), directive (D), monitoring (M), etc.[cite: 235].
    * **Management Area:** Composed of 4 process phases: Planning (APO), Deployment (BAI), Operation (DSS), and Monitoring (MEA)[cite: 235].

#### C) IT governance process
The IT governance process is composed of four stages:
1.  **Planning Stage:** Linking business with IT, setting IT goals, and establishing rules for IT activities[cite: 236].
2.  **Operations Stage:** Monitoring of IT resources, risks, and IT management[cite: 237].
