## I. Business Communication Overview

**Summary of Section I**

Business communication is fundamental to achieving organizational goals and reducing business costs through effective and efficient information exchange with stakeholders. Key elements include the sender, receiver, medium, and the process involves encoding, decoding, and feedback, all of which can be affected by noise. Communication is broadly classified into written, verbal, and non-verbal types, each with unique features and appropriate uses.

### I.01 Concept and Elements of Business Communication

**A) Definition of Business Communication**

*   **Business communication:** Defined as continuously managing something in a structured manner with a certain purpose and plan.
*   It refers to a system or process where various stakeholders share information and meanings.
*   The ultimate goal is to achieve business goals through this sharing of information.

**B) Elements of Business Communication**

The key components of business communication include:

*   The information to be shared.
*   The sender and receiver.
*   The medium for information sharing.
*   The process involves encoding (by the sender), decoding (by the receiver), and feedback.
*   Noise can interfere with the communication process.

**C) Types of Business Communication**

Communication can be classified into three types based on the medium and format.

| Classification | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Written        | Communication conducted in a certain format using letters. Various formats are used depending on the purpose of communication. Typically, feedback is available at a specific time point.                                                                                                |
| Verbal         | Communication conducted using words in a relatively flexible format. Allows real-time feedback.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Non-verbal     | Communication through facial expressions, voices, and gestures. Appeals to emotion rather than reason.<br>Example: According to The Law of Mehrabian, non-verbal gestures (change in breathing or skin color, eye contact, etc.) constitute 55% of communication, tone/intonation/voice constitutes 38%, and logical explanation only constitutes 7%. |

### I.02 Methods of Business Communication

**A) Bottom-up, top-down, horizontal business communication**

*   **Vertical communication:** Communication between supervisors and subordinates.
    *   **Top-down communication:** Includes instructions, commands, and deliveries from top to bottom of the organization.
    *   **Bottom-up communication:** Includes reports from bottom to top of the organization.
*   **Horizontal communication:** Communication between members or departments at a similar level within an organization. It is often required when dealing with complex and converged forms of tasks, such as consultation, circulation, and task forces.

**B) Communication channels and information integrity**

*   **Information integrity:** Refers to the amount and diversity of information delivered by a communication channel.
*   **Direct conversation** provides a very high level of information integrity, high delivery speed, and high speed of feedback.
*   **E-mail** provides a medium level of information integrity, is frequently used in business, and can deliver a message quickly while providing a record of communication.
*   **Official letters** made of figures and diagrams have a low level of information integrity, are delivered slowly, and require delivering complex and many contents at once.

**C) Methods of logical explanation and persuasion**

Logical explanation connects the objective grounds and subjective arguments as the basis for the argument. It is supported by deductive and inductive reasoning.

*   **Deductive reasoning:** Deriving a specific fact from general premises that are already known.
    *   Example: Premise 1: All men are mortal. Premise 2: Socrates is a man. Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
*   **Inductive reasoning:** Deriving a general principle from several concrete facts.
    *   Example: Concrete fact: Socrates is dead. General Principle: Therefore, a man is mortal.

## II. Business Problem Solving Techniques

**Summary of Section II**

Business problem-solving involves planning new opportunities ("blue ocean") and improving internal processes. Effective problem-solving requires both broad/in-depth knowledge and optimal combination efforts, leading to "problem-solving (wisdom)". The process involves four stages, utilizing creative thinking (Brainstorming, Six Thinking Hats, TRIZ) and logical thinking (MECE, Logic Tree, 80-20 Rule) techniques.

### II.01 Business Problem Solving Techniques

**A) Concept of business problem solving**

*   Problem-solving requires that all elements (knowledge, rules, facts) be accurately organized, defined, and resolved to ensure stable business continuity.
*   Achieving "problem-solving (wisdom)" requires combining broad and in-depth knowledge/information with efforts to find the best combination.

**B) Business problem solving process**

The general problem-solving process consists of four major stages:

1.  **Problem Definition:** Recognize the problem and define it clearly. It requires organizing the problem to grasp its essence, often using the MECE framework.
2.  **Cause Analysis:** Define and classify the causes of a structured problem, often by dissecting the problem into smaller components using a logical tree or fishbone diagram. The root cause is prioritized.
3.  **Alternative Development and Evaluation:** Develop various alternatives derived from the root cause analysis, evaluate them against criteria, and select the best one.
4.  **Solution Application and Feedback:** Verify the selected solution through a test bed, execute the plan, and provide feedback for improvement.

**C) Creative thinking techniques**

*   **Brainstorming:** A method designed to mentally rearrange ideas like a storm in the brain to generate ideas.
    *   Example: The process flows through Topic/Problem Description → Take note of comment/idea → Presentation of opinion/idea (sequential) → Presentation of opinion/idea (free speech) → Idea evaluation.
*   **Six Thinking Hats:** A method developed by Edward de Bono where six people take different roles (hats) to approach an issue and derive the optimal decision-making.
    *   Example: White Hat is for the role of objective explanation of facts or data.
*   **TRIZ (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving):** A systematic methodology for solving problems of invention, applying principles and solutions developed through thousands of inventions.
*   **SCAMPER:** An ideation method similar to brainstorming that uses acronyms (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Magnify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Rearrange, Reverse) to draw out random ideas.

**D) Logical thinking technique**

*   **MECE (Mutually Exclusive and Collectively Exhaustive):** A technique ensuring that elements are mutually exclusive (without duplication) and collectively exhaustive (without omission).
    *   Example: When segmenting time, dividing it into "the past, the present, and the future" satisfies the MECE principle.
*   **The Logic Tree:** A breakdown of key items in a tree form according to the MECE principle, used for problem-solving and strategy establishment.
*   **The 80-20 Rule (Pareto Rule):** States that the top 20% of people have 80% of total wealth, or that the top 20% of customers generate 80% of sales. Strategies based on this rule concentrate resources on solving the causal variable that is the essence of the problem, representing more than 80% of the possible solution.

**E) Rational decision-making techniques**

*   **Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MADM):** A technique considering the criteria of various factors rather than one criterion in the process of selecting the best alternative.
*   **Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP):** A technique that leads to the final decision by arranging the information in a hierarchical tree structure. This involves pairwise comparisons to evaluate and judge the elements of each class.

## III. Business Document Writing Technique

**Summary of Section III**

Business documents, essential for business activities, must be written accurately, concisely, and clearly in a standardized form. Writing business documents requires considering the end consumer's perspective and utilizing logical writing techniques like 5W2HT to ensure completeness and clarity. The types of documents include reports, official letters, meeting minutes, e-mails, proposals, plans, and manuals.

### III.01 Concept and Types of Business Documents

**A) Concept of business documents**

*   Business documents refer to all types of documents necessary for business activities.
*   These documents must be accurately described in a standardized form so that they are not misleading.
*   They should be written with concise phrases and objective expressions, avoiding lengthy phrases or emotional expressions.

**B) Types of business documents**

The types of business documents vary according to the content of work:

*   **Report:** A document prepared for reporting on the business feasibility of a product or idea.
    *   Example: Reports made during the planning process, such as planning reports, are called information reports. Reports made during the control process, such as inspection results reports, are called management reports.
*   **Letter:** A document used to evaluate the value of a product or idea.
*   **Proposal:** A document to obtain approval for business promotion.
*   **Plan:** A document to prepare a commercialization plan.
*   **Manual:** A document explaining the details of the plan/product.

---

### III.03 Methods of Writing Business Documents

**A) Methods of writing business documents (One-page report)**

*   The most used document in a business environment is the one-page report.
*   Deliver the key message on the first page: Key opinions and supplementary explanations should be attached as documents.
*   Write according to the table of contents: First, create a table of contents and compress all messages into one page.
*   The contents summarized according to the table of contents should focus on the keywords.
*   The content should be described based on the fact itself.

| 5W2HT Framework for One-Page Report |
| :---------------------------------- |
| **5W:** Why (Reason, significance), What (Content of the plan), Target (Subject, target of planning), When (Time and period of implementation), Where (Target area, place). |
| **2H:** How (Method, means), How much (Budget, profit plan).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

**B) Principles and methods of official letters**

*   **Approval:** The document conveying the intent of an organization is called the official letter. The text is a draft and requires approval from the head of the organization.
*   **Types of Approval:** Regular approval, discretionary approval, substitute approval, and cooperation.
*   **Detailed Writing Methods (Examples):**
    *   **Numbers:** Arabic numerals are the default.
    *   **Date:** Year, month, and day are separated by a dot (e.g., 2011.12.12).
    *   **Time:** Hours and minutes are expressed as numbers based on 24 hours, and separated by a colon (e.g., 5:30 pm).
*   **Attachment:** The attachment is marked at the beginning of the document right below the reference, title, etc., and if there is only one attachment, the number 1, 2, etc. is not assigned.

**C) Method of writing meeting minutes**

*   Meeting minutes clarify communication by organizing meeting results.
*   Minutes are written according to the 5W1H principle: When, where, who, what, how, and why.
*   Process: After writing, the minutes are circulated via e-mail to the attendees or published after public disclosure.

**D) Methods of writing e-mail**

*   E-mail is a highly utilized means of communication that often serves as an official letter.
*   **Methods of Writing Effective E-mail (Key Steps):**
    *   Write a title that clearly reveals the purpose of writing.
    *   Designate the recipient/reference person clearly.
    *   Write the content concisely and clearly, and describe the main content first (the main clause followed by the subordinate clause, deductive writing).
    *   The structure should be divided into 4 parts: greeting, headings, numbered details, and final thank-you message.
    *   Use numbering (1, 2, 3) and the email content (A, B, C) so the recipient can quickly understand the contents.
    *   CC (reference) column indicates the person who will read the email and give an opinion.

## IV. How to Write Technical Documents

**Summary of Section IV**

Technical documents are written using specialized terminology to record the description of reference documents, product handling, function, and architecture development. These documents must prioritize clarity, accuracy, and structuredness to provide sufficient information to both end users and administrators. They are commonly used in SW development and include documents like Proposals, Requirements Traceability Matrices, Analyses, Design Briefs, and Manuals.

### IV.01 Concept and Types of Technical Documents

**A) Definition of technical documents**

*   **Technical documents:** Documents that record the description of reference documents, product handling, function, and architecture development/use.
*   They provide sufficient information so that not only end users but also administrators and service/maintenance technicians can understand the interior/exterior of the product.
*   They are written using a lot of terminology according to specialized fields such as engineering, technology, and science.

**B) Features of technical documents**

1.  **Clarity:** The meaning should not be interpreted or distorted differently by readers; abstract language should be avoided.
2.  **Accuracy:** Should be written with accurate content, conforming to objective facts based on materials or data.
3.  **Structuredness:** Should offer a certain format, structured and written so as to achieve overall unity.

**C) Types of technical documents**

Technical documents are generally classified into two groups related to SW development:

*   **Project management:** Includes Business plan, Request for information (RFI), Request for Proposal (RFP), Proposal, Project management plan, Requirement Traceability Matrix, and Project completion report.

## VI. Presentation

**Summary of Section VI**

Presentations are vital for securing investment, supporting decision-making, and influencing project success. The design process involves setting clear goals, analyzing the audience (3P analysis), creating a compelling scenario, and preparing materials. Effective execution depends on confidence, clarity, and effective use of body language (which contributes 55% of communication).

### VI.01 Presentation Design and Preparation Process

**A) Purpose of presentation**

The presentation's purpose is generally categorized into three goals:

1.  **To inform:** Efficient delivery of information through presentation of evidence.
2.  **To persuade:** Sharing the speaker's perspective with the audience, encouraging them to understand the speaker's point of view.
3.  **To provoke action:** The final stage of preparation, requiring action (selection, order, adoption, acceptance).

**B) Presentation process**

The process involves several steps:

1.  Goal/topic setting.
2.  3P analysis: Comprehensive analysis of Person (audience/speaker), Purpose, and Place (environment).
3.  Content composition/design (determining the theme).
4.  Data collection/analysis.
5.  Delivery format (preparing data in a format that efficiently delivers the message).
6.  Rehearsal (practice based on the written data).
7.  Presentation (as rehearsal, be confident and clear).
8.  Post-processing (Q&A, feedback).

**C) Scenario creation**

The scenario is critical to preventing mistakes in writing presentation materials.

*   **Content Composition of Scenario:** Decide the order of points based on constraints (time, audience, purpose, expectation), and confirm the flow and scope of content.
*   **Length of Scenario:** Typically takes about 3 minutes for each A4 sheet. The scenario should be structured in a way that the presentation can be finished within the set timeframe.

---

### VI.02 Writing Techniques of Presentation Material

**A) Overall material composition**

*   The entire material is generally organized in the order of opening → table of contents → main text → closing.
*   The opening is crucial for the first impression; success or failure is determined within 30 seconds of the start.
*   The table of contents should be structured considering the length of the briefing session.

**C) Presentation material creation**

When creating material, the overall flow and table of contents should be clearly defined.

*   **Material Preparation Procedure:** Storyboard → Table of Contents (Mockup) → Draft (composition and written content) → Design (table of contents, opening, closing included).
*   **Use of Charts:** Charts are important to present information clearly.
    *   **Types:** Content (comparison of whole/percentage), Items (ranking), Time series (change over time), Distribution (number of items in the range), Correlation (relationship between variables).
    *   Example: A pie chart is effective for comparing a bar graph by percentage.

**E) Presentation tools**

*   **PowerPoint:** Commercial presentation tool, sold as part of MS Office. Strengths: Widely used, easy editing.
*   **Keynote:** Began as a computer program by Steve Jobs. Strengths: Easy to use for design/user interface, excellent graphics and animation effects.
*   **PREZI:** Web-based presentation tool. Strengths: Web-based, many templates, good organization.

---

### VI.03 Methods of Executing Presentation

**B) Effective use of body language**

*   Body language includes voice, tone, speed, and gestures. According to The Law of Mehrabian, 93% of non-verbal body language (gestures, tone of voice) is used to persuade the other person in actual communication.

1.  **Personal Appearance and Image:** Maintain a neat appearance, hairstyle, and attire. A smiling face is necessary.
2.  **Eye-contact:** Keep eyes clear and bright; insecure eye gaze reduces confidence. Distribute visual attention between the decision maker (60%) and the rest of the audience (40%).
3.  **Voice:** Explain with correct pronunciation and speed, using a resonant voice.
4.  **Use gestures for emphasis:** Effective when emphasizing important points.

## VII. Understanding of Project

**Summary of Section VII**

A project is a temporary effort to create a unique product, service, or result for a specific purpose. Projects are defined by constraints of scope, cost, time, and quality. Projects are managed within broader programs and portfolios, and organizations utilize structures like functional, matrix, and projectized organizations for execution. The Project Management Office (PMO) provides enterprise-wide project management support.

### VII.01 Concept of Project

**A) Definition of project**

*   **Project:** A sum of efforts to mobilize resources to achieve a specific goal.
*   A project refers to an activity where human and physical resources are put into place at a set (temporary) time to create a unique product or service, or for a specific purpose.
*   **Program:** A set of inter-related projects that aim to integrate multiple projects into a single program.
*   **Portfolio:** A set of programs and projects undertaken to achieve an organization's strategic goals.

**B) Features of project**

Projects have several core characteristics:

*   **Temporary:** Has a specific beginning and end.
*   **Uniqueness:** Every product or service is unique, offering a unique service to the customer.
*   **Progressive elaboration:** An activity to specify the product or service to be created from constructing the general meaning at the beginning.
*   **Constraint of scope, cost and time:** The most common constraints.
*   **Resource and quality:** A service that provides quality through resources to customers and stakeholders.

**Example: Practical Projects**

*   **E-government project:** A project to establish public information utilization using a framework for efficient government services to the public.
*   **Smart factory project:** A project to establish factory automation and digitalization using IT systems such as MES (Manufacturing Execution System).

---

### VII.02 Project Organizational Structures and Roles

**A) Project organizational structures**

Organizational structures related to project execution are divided into functional, matrix, and projectized organizations.

*   **Functional Organization:** A structure where an organization is divided into smaller groups based on each task or function, and the project group is composed independently from other groups.
    *   Detail: No separate project manager; the manager of the functional group performs project responsibilities.
*   **Projectized Organization:** A structure where the project manager is responsible for decision-making and has total authority for project execution.
*   **Matrix Organization:** A complex form combining functional and project-oriented organization.
    *   Types: Weak matrix (PM acts as facilitator), Balanced matrix (PM acts as coordinator), and Strong matrix (PM acts as manager).

**B) Responsibilities and roles of project manager (PM)**

The project manager is the person responsible for the entire scope and schedule of the project.

*   **PM's Competencies:** Include project management knowledge (basic usage of process/templates/tools), technical competency (knowledge of the project area, technical knowledge related to the project, information technology trends), and communication competency (negotiating skill, communication, human resource management).

**C) Project management office (PMO)**

*   **PMO:** An organization dedicated to enterprise-wide project management.
*   **Role:** PMOs prioritize projects and programs that become the organization's strategy. In government contexts, the PMO plays an oversight, consulting, and mediating role.
*   **PMO Classification (Examples):** Classified by PMO type (internal, external, combined), role & responsibility (Weather Station, Coach, Control Tower), position (full-time, part-time), and skill (development, consulting, evaluation).

## VIII. Project Process and Management

**Summary of Section VIII**

Project processes adhere to methodologies like PMBOK, ISO 21500, PRINCE2, and the Agile methodology. The project follows a life cycle (predictive, iterative, adaptive) involving five process groups (Initiating, Planning, Executing, Monitoring/Controlling, Closing). PMBOK defines management across 10 knowledge areas, including Scope, Schedule, Cost, and Risk Management.

### VIII.01 Project Life Cycle

**A) Project life cycle**

A project has a cycle composed of five processes: initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing.

*   **Process Groups:**
    1.  **Initiating process group:** Formal project initiation, stakeholder identification, project charter development.
    2.  **Planning process group:** All planning activities to achieve project goals.
    3.  **Executing process group:** Completes tasks defined in the project management plan.
    4.  **Monitoring and controlling process group:** Tracking project performance, making adjustments.
    5.  **Closing process group:** Completes all activities including contractual obligations.
*   **Predictive life cycle:** A planning-focused life cycle where the entire scope, schedule, and cost are determined at the beginning of the project.
*   **Iterative life cycles:** Models where the product is divided into parts developed repeatedly to complete a final product. These include incremental life cycles (scope divided into multiple phases running in parallel) and evolutionary life cycles (project divided into several phases, iteration repeats sequentially).

**B) Project planning and executing**

*   The initial project planning stage is crucial because errors or issues neglected early on can cause exponential costs/efforts later.

**Example: Project Cost/Efforts Curve**

*   A poor planning scenario shows that costs rise exponentially over time.

---

### VIII.02 Project Management Methodology

**A) Project management methodology**

*   **PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge):** The most representative methodology by the PMI (Project Management Institute). The 6th edition contains five process groups, 10 knowledge areas, and 49 detailed processes.
*   **ISO 21500:** An international standardization for project management, similar to PMBOK.
*   **PRINCE2 (Projects IN Controlled Environments 2):** A structured project management methodology developed in the UK.

**B) Agile methodology**

*   **Agile methodology:** An adaptive model that continuously creates prototypes at regular intervals, allowing changes in a timely manner.
*   **Manifesto for Agile Software Development:** Emphasizes individuals and interactions over processes and tools, and working software over comprehensive documentation.
*   **Agile Process:** The Scrum process consists of sprint planning, daily scrum, sprint review, and sprint retrospective.

**C) Project management area (10 Knowledge Areas)**

The PMBOK and ISO 21500 methodology framework divides project management into 10 knowledge areas:

1.  **Project Integration Management:** Key area managing processes and activities necessary to identify, define, and coordinate management activities within the process group.
2.  **Scope Management:** Defining customer requirements and designing WBS (Work Breakdown Structure).
3.  **Schedule Management:** Developing a schedule by understanding the relationships between activities and allocating resources.
4.  **Cost Management:** Planning, calculating, budgeting, and controlling activities.
5.  **Quality Management:** Managing a series of activities related to quality planning, assurance, and control.
6.  **Resource Management:** Managing resources available to the project.

## IX. Scope Management

**Summary of Section IX**

Scope management defines, verifies, and controls the project scope to prevent failures caused by scope change. The key process involves requirements collection, scope definition, and creating the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to break down deliverables into manageable components.

### IX.01 Concept and Process of Scope Management

**A) Concept of scope management**

*   **Scope:** The sum of products and services provided through the project, and the range of work required to successfully complete the project.
*   **Project Scope:** Refers to all the work required to create products, services, and outputs.
*   **Product Scope:** Refers to the features and functions of the product.

**B) Scope management process**

The scope management process involves five core steps:

1.  **Scope Management Planning:** Defines how the scope will be managed.
2.  **Collect Requirements:** Finding out what the customer needs and why they need it.
3.  **Scope Definition:** Identifying the key scope of the project and formulating detailed scope statements. The scope should be clear, complete, agreed-upon, and manageable.
4.  **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Formulation:** Decomposes deliverables and the entire project scope into manageable components.
5.  **Scope Identification:** Process of formal confirmation with the client or project leader for deliverables.
6.  **Scope Control:** Monitoring project status and product range, and managing changes.

---

### IX.02 Scope Management Technique

**A) Work breakdown structure (WBS)**

*   **WBS Definition:** A hierarchical structure of tasks broken down into manageable work packages, which are classified based on project deliverables. WBS is critical for scope management.
*   **Components of WBS:** Work Package (lowest-level work unit for which cost and duration are estimated), Code of Account (unique identification/numbering), WBS Dictionary (detailed description of each work package), and RAM (Responsibility Assignment Matrix).
*   **Principles for creating WBS:**
    *   **Deliverable-based:** Focused on tangible deliverables to control the scope of work.
    *   **Manageable:** The lowest unit (Work Package) is usually divided into a duration of around 80 hours (2 weeks).
    *   **Detailed segmentation:** Subdivided into units that can be processed within 1-2 weeks by project members.

---

## X. Schedule Management

**Summary of Section X**

Schedule management defines activities, sequences them, estimates duration, and controls the schedule. Key scheduling techniques include the Critical Path Method (CPM), which determines the minimum project duration, and the Critical Chain Method (CCM), which manages buffers to account for limited resources and uncertainty.

### X.01 Concept and Process of Schedule Management

**A) Concept of schedule management**

*   **Schedule:** A display of the start and finish dates of each activity.
*   **Importance:** Distinguishes the timetable for a simple goal from the dependencies between work, resources required, and time/cost control.

**B) Schedule management process**

The process includes:

1.  **Schedule Planning:** Formulating the project schedule management plan.
2.  **Definition of Activity:** Identifying and documenting all relevant activities.
3.  **Sequencing of Activity:** Identifying the relationship between activities in a logical order.
4.  **Estimation of Activity Duration:** Estimating the time each activity will take.
    *   **Estimation Methods:** Expert Judgment, Analogous Estimating (referring to similar projects), and Three-point Estimating (using optimistic, most likely, and pessimistic values).
    *   **Three-point Formula (PERT):** Average = (P + 4M + O) / 6, where O=Optimistic, M=Most Likely, P=Pessimistic.
5.  **Schedule Development:** Creating the project schedule.
6.  **Schedule Control:** Managing changes to the schedule while monitoring its status.

### X.02 Schedule Management Technique

**A) Schedule development technique - critical path method (CPM)**

*   **CPM Definition:** A network analysis technique used to determine the minimum duration of a project by finding the path that determines the minimum duration—the critical path.
*   **Key Components (Calculations):**
    *   **Early Start (ES):** The earliest date an activity can possibly begin.
    *   **Late Finish (LF):** The latest date an activity can finish without delaying the project.
    *   **Total Float:** The amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the project finish date.
*   The critical path is the path where the Total Float is zero.

**B) Schedule development technique - critical chain method (CCM)**

*   **CCM Definition:** A scheduling method that allows the project team to buffer the project schedule in consideration of limited resources and uncertainty.
*   **Concept:** Project Buffer is added at the end of the critical chain to prevent the target finish date from slippage. Feeding Buffer is added to non-critical activities that merge into the critical chain to account for their uncertainty.

**C) Schedule compression technique - crashing and fast tracking**

Compression techniques are necessary when the project date cannot be changed due to requirements changes.

*   **Crashing:** Compresses the schedule by adding extra resources at minimum cost. It is effective only for activities of which duration is shortened by replenishing resources in the critical path.
*   **Fast Tracking:** Shortening a period by performing tasks sequentially conducted simultaneously in a specific section. It is effective only when activities can be overlapped to shorten the project duration.

## XI. Cost Management

**Summary of Section XI**

Cost management involves planning, estimating, budgeting, and controlling costs to complete a project within the approved budget. Estimation techniques include Function Point (FP), Man/Month (MM), and COCOMO. Earned Value Management (EVM) is the primary tool for measuring work value, schedule, and cost performance.

### XI.01 Concept of Cost Management

**A) Concept of cost**

*   **Cost:** The monetary value of resources invested in the production of a product or service.
*   Cost is used for the profit and loss measurement, measured based on the project execution period.

**C) Concept of cost management**

Cost management is a set of activities to plan, calculate, procure, manage, and control the budget so that the project can be eventually completed within the approved budget.

---

### XI.02 Concept of Cost Management (Process)

The cost management process includes cost management planning, cost estimation, budgeting, and cost control.

*   **Cost Estimation Techniques (Examples):** Analogous Estimating (estimating based on similar past projects), Bottom-up Estimating (estimating the sum of lowest-level work packages), Expert Judgment, and Three-point Estimating.

*   It quantifies software functions requested by and delivered to users from the user's point of view.
*   **Function Types:** Divided into Data Functions (Internal Logical File (ILF), External Interface File (EIF)) and Transaction Functions (External Input (EI), External Output (EO), External Inquiry (EQ)).

**B) Man/Month (MM)**

*   **Man/Month (MM):** A method of measuring how much labor is consumed in a project based on previous experience.
*   **Calculation:** Project development cost = direct labor cost + overhead cost + royalty + direct cost.

**C) COCOMO (Constructive Cost Model)**

*   **COCOMO:** One of the estimation methods of the cost of a software development project, using a regression formula with parameters such as development period, man per month, and maintenance costs.
*   **Types:** Divided into Basic, Intermediate, and Detailed, depending on complexity.
*   **Basic COCOMO Formula (Effort Applied):** E=a∗(KLOC)ᵇ.

---

### XI.04 Cost Management Technique - Earned Value Management (EVM)

**A) Concept of earned value**

*   **Earned Value (EV):** Means the value of the work actually done at the point of measurement. EV is also called BCWP (Budgeted Cost of Work Performed).
*   **Planned Value (PV):** The approved budget for the work planned to date.
*   **Actual Cost (AC):** The cost actually incurred for the work completed.

**B) Earned value management**

*   **EVM Definition:** A project performance management technique that analyzes performance through integrated management of project schedule and cost.
*   **Schedule Variance (SV):** SV=EV−PV (EV minus PV). SV>0 means ahead of schedule.
*   **Cost Variance (CV):** CV=EV−AC (EV minus AC). CV>0 means under budget.
*   **Schedule Performance Index (SPI):** SPI=EV/PV. SPI<1 means behind schedule.
*   **Cost Performance Index (CPI):** CPI=EV/AC. CPI>1 means under budget.
*   **Estimate At Completion (EAC):** The estimated total cost at project completion.

## XIII. Risk Management

**Summary of Section XIII**

Risk management is a systematic business management technique for addressing uncertainty. The process involves risk planning, identification, qualitative/quantitative analysis, response, and control. Risk response strategies are tailored to minimize threats (Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, Accept) and maximize positive opportunities (Exploit, Share, Enhance, Acceptance).

### XIII.01 Concept of Risk Management

*   **Project Risk:** Refers to a situation in which uncertain events occur that negatively or positively affect project goals (scope, schedule, cost, quality).
*   **Risk Management:** An activity that defines how to manage risks and identifies their impacts.
*   **Risk Types:** Classified into Known Risk (risks that can be identified in advance) and Unknown Risk (risks that cannot be identified).
    *   **Contingency Reserve:** Allocated to work packages for known risks (about 10% of total project cost).
    *   **Management Reserve:** Separately managed by management outside the project for unknown risks.

---

### XIII.02 Risk Management Process

The risk management process is carried out over four stages:

1.  **Risk Identification:** Identifying and documenting risks that may affect the project.
2.  **Risk Analysis/Evaluation:** Qualitative and quantitative analysis.
3.  **Risk Response:** Risk mitigation, transfer, acceptance, or exploitation.
4.  **Risk Control:** Observation, re-assessment, early warning system.

**A) Risk identification**

*   **Methods (Examples):** Document Reviews, Information Gathering Techniques (Brainstorming, Delphi Technique), Checklist Analysis (based on predecessors/knowledge accumulated in similar projects), SWOT Analysis (investigating internal risks), and Expert Judgment.

**B) Qualitative risk analysis**

*   **Qualitative risk analysis:** Analyzing how much impact the risk has on the project based on probability and impact.
*   **Technique:** Probability-Impact Matrix (evaluates the probability of a risk and its impact).

**C) Quantitative risk analysis**

*   **Quantitative risk analysis:** A numeric estimate of the overall effect of prioritized risks on project objectives.
*   **Methods (Examples):** Interviewing, Probability Distributions, Tornado Diagrams (displaying the results of change), Scenario Analysis, Monte Carlo Simulation (statistical technique generating random variables).
*   **EMV Analysis (Expected Monetary Value):** Multiplying the expected monetary value with risks taken into account; used for decision tree analysis.

**D) Risk response**

The risk response applies different strategies based on whether the risk is positive or negative.

| Negative Risk Response Strategy (Threats)                   | Positive Risk Response Strategy (Opportunities)                                                                    |
| :---------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Avoid:** Isolating or changing the project's objectives to eliminate the threat. | **Exploit:** An activity that dominates uncertainty so that opportunities are evident during execution.               |
| **Transfer:** Transferring the impact and subject of risk to a third party (e.g., commercial risk exposure via insurance). | **Share:** Partnering with a third party to improve the probability of the opportunity.                             |
| **Mitigate:** Reducing the likelihood or impact of the risk.                      | **Enhance:** Increasing the probability or impact of the opportunity.                                            |
| **Acceptance:** Adopting the strategy when risk elimination is not possible (passive acceptance) or actively building a contingency reserve. | **Acceptance:** Choosing to take advantage of opportunities but not actively pursuing them. |

### XIV.02 Concept of Project Monitoring and Evaluation

**A) Concept of project monitoring and evaluation**

Project monitoring and evaluation assesses whether the project was completed within schedule and budget.

*   **Evaluation Focus:** Generally conducted in three aspects: a financial perspective, a management perspective, and a technical perspective.

**B) Project evaluation**

Project evaluation measures everything from the start of the project to the project investment after the end.

*   **Evaluation through PMO:** Investment evaluation manages requirements analysis and risk analysis.
*   **Evaluation Items (Example):** Return on investment, sales increase effect, cost reduction effect, user satisfaction, and competitive differentiation.

**C) Project evaluation stage and focal point**

The evaluation stage is divided into three types depending on when the project is evaluated:

1.  **Ex-ante Evaluation:** Analyzes the feasibility of the project in advance and supports decision-making. Conducted frequently to decide whether to proceed and annually to establish the budget for the next year.
2.  **Interim Evaluation:** Conducted in the form of evaluation, supervision, and inspection during the project.
3.  **Ex-post Evaluation:** Performed in a period of time after the project is completed. Checks confirmation of project effectiveness and investment feasibility.
