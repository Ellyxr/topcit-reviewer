# IT Business and Strategy Overview

## I. The Concept of IT Business

### Summary of Section I
IT business involves activities that **integrate information technology (IT) into corporate processes** to achieve business objectives. It has evolved from a simple support function to a core, integrated element that creates a competitive advantage. This section covers IT resources, management practices, and the IT business value chain.

### I.01 The Concept of IT Business: A Summary

#### Key Concepts and Definitions
* **IT business:** All activities carried out by integrating IT into a broad range of processes to realize the business objectives of a company.
* **Evolution of IT:** Initially used sparingly, computers now play a key role in companies' decision-making from an enterprise-wide perspective. Since 2010, IT has been tightly merged with business processes to gain a competitive advantage.
* **Alignment of Business and IT:** IT's interdependence with business strategy objectives and processes is maximized.
* **Strategic Alignment:** The relationship between business and IT can be analyzed using a 2-dimensional diagram, subdivided into external focus (business environment) and internal focus (management).
* **Strategic Links:** Requires achieving strategic alignment across four complementary areas: business strategy, IT strategy, organizational infrastructure and processes, and IT infrastructure and processes.

### I.02 IT Business Ecosystem

#### A) IT business and the hype cycle
The **Hype Cycle** shows changes in the expected level of industrial economic value and the impact of new technologies.

| Phase No. | Phase Name | Description |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Innovation trigger | New technologies are first introduced, and people expect great things from them. |
| 2 | Peak of Inflated Expectations | The period before the new technology starts to become more exaggerated than what it can actually deliver. |
| 3 | Trough of Disillusionment | The period when the bubble bursts, after which the technology enters a period of retreat. |
| 4 | Slope of Enlightenment | Organizations for the technology start to climb steadily once again. |
| 5 | Plateau of Productivity | The period when the technology generates steady values. |

#### C) Components of an IT business ecosystem
The IT ecosystem is composed of five components, referred to as **CPNDS** (Contents, Platform, Network, Device, and Security).
* **Platform (P):** IT service providers are evolving from individual services to a common platform where multiple business partners gather. (Example: Apple, Google, and Kakao ).
* **Security (S):** IT cyber threats are leading to an increase in damages due to the increased use of IT by key national infrastructures. Cyber targeted attacks aim to steal information or damage corporate systems.

### I.03 IT Resources and Management Activities for IT Business

**IT resources** encompass people, processes, software, and hardware used to run an IT business. They include IT support systems and IT management systems (e.g., ERP, SCM, and PLM), along with IT infrastructure.

#### B) The role of IT resources
IT resources benefit businesses in three main ways:
1.  **Improved production efficiency:** Using IT resources to improve overall production efficiency. (Example: Domestic supermarkets monitor customer purchasing patterns in real-time to maximize sales ).
2.  **Creation of new business values:** New business values emerge through the application of IT resources, such as Apple's online music distribution structure.
3.  **Expansion of global business:** IT resources enable a global cooperative working environment and exchange of information without space and time constraints.

The IT business's cyclical management activities follow the traditional **POCA** (Planning, Operation, Check, and Corrective Action) management cycle.
* **Plan (P):** Identify opportunities/issues, set goals/scope, and link business with IT.
* **Execution (O):** Configure IT solution and collect IT solution operational data.
* **Check (C):** Analyze IT solution operational results, monitor business-IT performance metrics, and test alignment.
